\title{A package for personality, psychometric, and psychological research}
\description{Overview of the psych package.

The psych package has been developed at Northwestern University to include functions most useful for personality and psychological research.  Some of the functions (e.g., \code{\link[psychTools]{read.file}}, \code{\link[psychTools]{read.clipboard}}, \code{\link{describe}},  \code{\link{pairs.panels}}, \code{\link{error.bars}} and \code{\link{error.dots}}) are useful for basic data entry and descriptive analyses. Use help(package="psych") or objects("package:psych") for a list of all functions.  Two vignettes are included as part of the package.  The intro vignette tells how to install psych and overview vignette provides examples of using psych in many applications.  In addition, there are a growing set of tutorials available on the \url{https://personality-project.org/r/} webpages. 

A companion package \code{\link[psychTools]{psychTools}} includes larger data set examples and four more vignette. 

Psychometric applications include routines (\code{\link{fa}} for  maximum likelihood (fm="mle"), minimum residual (fm="minres"), minimum rank (fm=minrank)  principal axes (fm="pa") and weighted least squares (fm="wls")  factor analysis  as well as functions to do Schmid Leiman transformations (\code{\link{schmid}}) to transform a hierarchical factor structure into a bifactor solution. Principal Components Analysis (\code{\link{pca}}) is also available.  Rotations  may be done using factor or components transformations to a target matrix include the standard Promax transformation (\code{\link{Promax}}), a transformation to a cluster target, or to any simple target matrix (\code{\link{target.rot}}) as well as the ability to call many of the GPArotation functions (e.g., oblimin, quartimin, varimax, geomin, ...). Functions for determining the number of factors in a data matrix include Very Simple Structure (\code{\link{VSS}}) and Minimum Average Partial correlation (\code{\link{MAP}}). 

An alternative approach to factor analysis is Item Cluster Analysis (\code{\link{ICLUST}}). This function is particularly appropriate for exploratory scale construction.

There are a number of functions for finding various reliability coefficients (see Revelle and Condon, 2019). These include the traditional  \code{\link{alpha}}  (found for multiple scales and with more useful output by \code{\link{scoreItems}}, \code{\link{score.multiple.choice}}), beta (\code{\link{ICLUST}}) and  both of McDonald's omega coefficients (\code{\link{omega}}, \code{\link{omegaSem}} and  \code{\link{omega.diagram}}) as well as Guttman's six estimates of internal consistency reliability (\code{\link{guttman}}) and the six measures of Intraclass correlation coefficients (\code{\link{ICC}}) discussed by Shrout and Fleiss are also available.  

Multilevel analyses may be done by \code{\link{statsBy}} and  \code{\link{multilevel.reliability}}.

The \code{\link{scoreItems}}, and \code{\link{score.multiple.choice}} functions may be used to form single or multiple scales from sets of dichotomous, multilevel, or multiple choice items by specifying scoring keys.  \code{\link{scoreOverlap}} correct interscale correlations for overlapping items, so that it is possible to examine hierarchical or nested structures.

Scales can be formed that best predict (after cross validation) particular criteria using \code{\link{bestScales}} using unit weighted or correlation weights. This procedure, also called  the \code{\link{BISCUIT}} algorithm (Best Items Scales that are Cross validated, Unit weighted, Informative, and Transparent) is a simple alternative to more complicated supervised machine learning algorithms.


Additional functions make for more convenient descriptions of item characteristics  include 1 and 2 parameter Item Response measures.  The \code{\link{tetrachoric}}, \code{\link{polychoric}} and \code{\link{irt.fa}} functions are used to find 2 parameter descriptions of item functioning. \code{\link{scoreIrt}}, \code{\link{scoreIrt.1pl}} and \code{\link{scoreIrt.2pl}} do basic IRT based scoring.

 A number of procedures have been developed as part of the Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment (SAPA \url{https://www.sapa-project.org/}) project.  These routines facilitate forming and analyzing composite scales equivalent to using the raw data but doing so by adding within and between cluster/scale item correlations. These functions include extracting clusters from factor loading matrices (\code{\link{factor2cluster}}), synthetically forming clusters from correlation matrices (\code{\link{cluster.cor}}), and finding multiple  ((\code{\link{lmCor}}) and partial ((\code{\link{partial.r}}) correlations from correlation matrices.
 
 If forming empirical scales, or testing out multiple regressions, it is important to cross validate the results.  \code{\link{crossValidation}} will do this on a different data set.
 
\code{\link{lmCor}} and \code{\link{mediate}} meet the desire to do regressions and mediation analysis from either raw data or from correlation matrices.  If raw data are provided, these functions can also do  moderation analyses.
 
 Functions to generate simulated data with particular structures include \code{\link{sim.circ}} (for circumplex structures), \code{\link{sim.item}} (for general structures) and \code{\link{sim.congeneric}} (for a specific demonstration of congeneric measurement).  The functions \code{\link{sim.congeneric}}  and \code{\link{sim.hierarchical}} can be used to create data sets with particular structural properties. A more general form for all of these is \code{\link{sim.structural}} for generating general structural models.  These are discussed in more detail in the vignette (psych_for_sem).

 Functions to apply various standard statistical tests include \code{\link{p.rep}} and its variants for testing the probability of replication, \code{\link{r.con}} for the confidence intervals of a correlation, and \code{\link{r.test}} to test single, paired, or sets of correlations. 
 

 
 In order to study diurnal or circadian variations in mood, it is helpful to use circular statistics.  Functions to find the circular mean (\code{\link{circadian.mean}}), circular (phasic) correlations (\code{\link{circadian.cor}}) and the correlation between linear variables and circular variables (\code{\link{circadian.linear.cor}}) supplement a function to find the best fitting phase angle (\code{\link{cosinor}}) for measures taken with a fixed period (e.g., 24 hours).
 
 A dynamic model of personality and motivation (the Cues-Tendency-Actions model) is include as \code{\link{cta}}.
 
 A number of useful helper functions allow for data input (\code{\link[psychTools]{read.file}}), and data manipulation \code{\link{cs}} and \code{\link[psychTools]{dfOrder}},

 
 The most recent development version of the package is always available for download as a \emph{source} file from the repository at the PMC lab:
 
   install.packages("psych", repos = "https://personality-project.org/r/", type="source").
   
    This will provide the most recent version for PCs and Macs.

\details{Two vignettes (intro.pdf and scoring.pdf) are useful introductions to the package. They may be found as vignettes in R or may be downloaded from 
\url{https://personality-project.org/r/psych/intro.pdf} \url{https://personality-project.org/r/psych/overview.pdf} and \url{https://personality-project.org/r/psych/psych_for_sem.pdf}.  In addition, there are a number of "HowTo"s available at \url{https://personality-project.org/r/} 

The more important functions in the package are for the analysis of multivariate data, with an emphasis upon those functions useful in scale construction of item composites. However, there are a number of very useful functions for basic data manipulation including  
\code{\link[psychTools]{read.file}}, \code{\link[psychTools]{read.clipboard}}, \code{\link{describe}},  \code{\link{pairs.panels}}, \code{\link{error.bars}} and \code{\link{error.dots}}) which are useful for basic data entry and descriptive analyses.



When given a set of items from a personality inventory, one goal is to combine these into higher level item composites. This leads to several questions:

1) What are the basic properties of the data?  \code{\link{describe}} reports basic summary statistics (mean, sd, median, mad, range,  minimum, maximum, skew, kurtosis, standard error) for vectors, columns of matrices, or data.frames. \code{\link{describeBy}} provides descriptive statistics, organized by one or more grouping variables. \code{\link{statsBy}} provides even more detail for data structured by groups including within and between correlation matrices, ICCs for group differences, as well as basic descriptive statistics organized by group.

 \code{\link{pairs.panels}} shows scatter plot matrices (SPLOMs) as well as histograms and the Pearson correlation for scales or items. \code{\link{error.bars}} will plot variable means with associated confidence intervals. \code{\link{errorCircles}} will plot confidence intervals for both the x and y coordinates.  \code{\link{corr.test}} will find the significance values for a matrix of correlations. \code{\link{error.dots}} creates a dot chart with confidence intervals.

2) What is the most appropriate number of item composites to form? After finding  either standard Pearson correlations, or finding tetrachoric or polychoric correlations,  the dimensionality of the correlation matrix may be examined. The number of factors/components problem is a standard question of factor analysis, cluster analysis, or principal components analysis. Unfortunately, there is no agreed upon answer. The Very Simple Structure (\code{\link{VSS}}) set of procedures has been proposed as on answer to the question of the optimal number of factors.  Other procedures (\code{\link{VSS.scree}},  \code{\link{VSS.parallel}},  \code{\link{fa.parallel}}, and \code{\link{MAP}})  also address this question.  \code{\link{nfactors}} combine several of these approaches into one convenient function. Unfortunately, there is no best answer to the problem.

3) What are the best composites to form?  Although this may be answered using principal components  (\code{\link{principal}}, aka \code{\link{pca}}), principal axis (\code{\link{factor.pa}}) or minimum residual (\code{\link{factor.minres}})  factor analysis (all part of the \code{\link{fa}} function) and to show the results graphically (\code{\link{fa.diagram})}, it is sometimes more useful to address this question using cluster analytic techniques.  Previous versions of \code{\link{ICLUST}} (e.g., Revelle, 1979)  have been shown to be particularly successful at forming maximally consistent and independent item composites.  Graphical output from \code{\link{ICLUST.graph}} uses the Graphviz dot language and allows one to write files suitable for Graphviz.  If Rgraphviz is available, these graphs can be done in R.

Graphical organizations of cluster and factor analysis output can be done using  \code{\link{cluster.plot}} which plots items by cluster/factor loadings and assigns items to that dimension with the highest loading.  

4) How well does a particular item composite reflect a single construct?  This is a question of reliability and general factor saturation.  Multiple solutions for this problem result in (Cronbach's) alpha (\code{\link{alpha}}, \code{\link{scoreItems}}), (Revelle's) Beta (\code{\link{ICLUST}}), and (McDonald's) \code{\link{omega}} (both omega hierarchical and omega total). Additional reliability estimates may be found in the \code{\link{guttman}} function.

This can also be examined by applying \code{\link{irt.fa}} Item Response Theory techniques using factor analysis of the \code{\link{tetrachoric}} or \code{\link{polychoric}} correlation matrices and converting the results into the standard two parameter parameterization of item difficulty and item discrimination.  Information functions for the items suggest where they are most effective.

5) For some applications, data matrices are synthetically combined from sampling different items for different people.  So called Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessement (SAPA) techniques allow the formation of large correlation or covariance matrices even though no one person has taken all of the items. To analyze such data sets, it is easy to form item composites based upon the covariance matrix of the items, rather than original data set.  These matrices may then be analyzed using a number of functions (e.g., \code{\link{cluster.cor}},   \code{\link{fa}}, \code{\link{ICLUST}}, \code{\link{pca}}, \code{\link{mat.regress}}, and \code{\link{factor2cluster}}.

6) More typically, one has a raw data set to analyze. \code{\link{alpha}} will report several reliablity estimates as well as item-whole correlations for items forming a single scale, \code{\link{score.items}} will score data sets on multiple scales, reporting the scale scores, item-scale and scale-scale correlations, as well as coefficient alpha,  alpha-1 and G6+. Using a `keys' matrix (created by \code{\link{make.keys}} or by hand), scales can have overlapping or independent items. \code{\link{score.multiple.choice}} scores multiple choice items or converts multiple choice items to dichtomous (0/1) format for other functions. 

If the scales have overlapping items, then \code{\link{scoreOverlap}} will give similar statistics, but correcting for the item overlap.

7) The \code{\link{reliability}} function combines the output from several different ways to estimate reliability including \code{\link{omega}} and \code{\link{splitHalf}}.

8) In addition to classical test theory (CTT) based scores of either totals or averages, 1 and 2 parameter IRT based scores may be found with \code{\link{scoreIrt.1pl}}, \code{\link{scoreIrt.2pl}} or more generally \code{\link{scoreIrt}}. Although highly correlated with CTT estimates, these scores take advantage of different item difficulties and are particularly appropriate for the problem of missing data. 

9) If the data has a multilevel structure (e.g, items nested within time nested within subjects) the \code{\link{multilevel.reliability}} aka \code{\link{mlr}} function will estimate generalizability coefficients for data over subjects, subjects over time, etc. \code{\link{mlPlot}} will provide plots for each subject of items over time. \code{\link{mlArrange}} takes the conventional wide output format and converts it to the long format necessary for some multilevel functions. Other functions useful for multilevel data include \code{\link{statsBy}} and \code{\link{faBy}}.    

An additional set of functions generate simulated data to meet certain structural properties. \code{\link{sim.anova}} produces data simulating a 3 way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or linear model with or with out repeated measures. \code{\link{sim.item}} creates simple structure data,  \code{\link{sim.circ}} will produce circumplex structured data,  \code{\link{sim.dichot}} produces circumplex or simple structured data for dichotomous items.  These item structures are useful for understanding the effects of skew, differential item endorsement on factor and cluster analytic soutions.  \code{\link{sim.structural}} will produce correlation matrices and data matrices to match general structural models. (See the vignette).


When examining personality items, some people like to discuss them as representing items in a two dimensional space with a circumplex structure.  Tests of circumplex fit \code{\link{circ.tests}} have been developed.  When representing items in a circumplex, it is convenient to view them in \code{\link{polar}} coordinates. 

Additional functions for testing the difference between two independent or dependent correlation \code{\link{r.test}}, to find the \code{\link{phi}} or \code{\link{Yule}} coefficients from a two by table, or to find the confidence interval of a correlation coefficient.    

Many data sets are included: \code{\link[psychTools]{bfi}} represents 25 personality items thought to represent five factors of personality, \code{\link[psychTools]{ability}} has 14 multiple choice iq items. \code{\link{sat.act}} has data on self reported test scores by age and gender. \code{\link[psychTools]{galton} }  Galton's data set of the heights of parents and their children. \code{\link[psychTools]{peas}} recreates the original Galton data set of the genetics of sweet peas.  \code{\link[psychTools]{heights}} and
\code{\link[psychTools]{cubits}} provide even more Galton data, \code{\link[psychTools]{vegetables}} provides the Guilford preference matrix of vegetables.  \code{\link[psychTools]{cities}} provides airline miles between 11 US cities (demo data for multidimensional scaling).

\cr
Some functions require other packages. Specifically, omega and schmid require the GPArotation package,  ICLUST.rgraph and fa.graph require Rgraphviz but have alternatives using the diagram functions.  i.e.:
\cr

\tabular{ll}{
function  \tab     requires\cr
\link{omega}    \tab     GPArotation \cr
\link{schmid}    \tab     GPArotation\cr
