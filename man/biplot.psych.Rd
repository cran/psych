\title{Draw biplots of factor or component scores by factor or component loadings}
\description{Extends the biplot function to the output of \code{\link{fa}}, \code{\link{fa.poly}}  or \code{\link{principal}}. Will plot factor scores and factor loadings in the same graph.  If the number of factors > 2, then all pairs of factors are plotted. Factor score histograms are plotted on the diagonal. The input is the resulting object from \code{\link{fa}}, \code{\link{principal}}, or \code{\link{fa.poly}} with the scores=TRUE option. Points may be colored according to other criteria.

}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{The output from \code{\link{fa}}, \code{\link{fa.poly}} or \code{\link{principal}}  with the scores=TRUE option}
  \item{labels}{if NULL, draw the points with the plot character (pch) specified. 
   To identify the data points, specify labels= 1:n  where n is the number of 
   observations, or labels =rownames(data) where data was the data set analyzed
    by the factor analysis.}
  \item{cex}{A vector of plot sizes of the data labels and of the factor labels}
  \item{main}{A main title for a two factor biplot}
  \item{hist.col}{If plotting more than two factors, the color of the histogram of the factor scores}
  \item{xlim.s}{x limits of the scores. Defaults to plus/minus three sigma}
  \item{ylim.s}{y limits of the scores.Defaults to plus/minus three sigma}
  \item{xlim.f}{x limits of the factor loadings.Defaults to plus/minus 1.0}
  \item{ylim.f}{y limits of the factor loadings.Defaults to plus/minus 1.0}
  \item{maxpoints}{When plotting 3 (or more) dimensions, at what size should we switch 
  from plotting "o" to plotting "."}
  \item{adjust}{an adjustment factor in the histogram}
  \item{col}{a vector of colors for the data points and for the factor loading labels}
  \item{pos}{If plotting labels, what position should they be in? 1=below, 2=left,
   3 top, 4 right.
  If missing, then the assumption is that labels should be printed instead of data points.}
  \item{arrow.len}{ the length of the arrow head}
  \item{pch}{The plotting character to use.  pch=16 gives reasonable size dots.
    pch="." gives tiny points.  If adding colors, use pch between 21 and 25. 
     (see examples).}
  \item{choose}{Plot just the specified factors}
  \item{cuts}{Do not label cases with abs(factor scores) < cuts) (Actually,
   the  distance of the x and y scores from 0) }
  \item{cutl}{Do not label variables with communalities in the two space < cutl}
  \item{group}{A vector of a grouping variable for the scores.  Show a different color 
  and symbol for each group.}
  \item{smoother}{If TRUE then do a smooth scatter plot (which shows the density rather than the data points). Only useful for large data sets.}
  \item{vars}{If TRUE, draw arrows for the variables, and plot the scores.  If FALSE, then draw arrows for the scores and plot the variables.}
  \item{\dots}{more options for graphics}

\details{
Uses the generic biplot function to take the output of a factor analysis \code{\link{fa}}, \code{\link{fa.poly}} or principal components analysis \code{\link{principal}} and plot the factor/component scores along with the factor/component loadings.

This is an extension of the generic biplot function to allow more control over plotting points in a two space and also to plot three or more factors (two at time).  

This will work for objects produced by \code{\link{fa}}, \code{\link{fa.poly}} or \code{\link{principal}}  if they applied to the original data matrix.  If however, one has a correlation matrix (e.g., based upon the output from \code{\link{tetrachoric}} or \code{\link{polychoric}}), and has done either \code{\link{fa}} or \code{\link{principal}} on the correlations, then obviously, we can not do a biplot.  

However, both of those functions produce a weights matrix, which, in combination with the original data can be used to find the scores by using \code{\link{factor.scores}}.  Since biplot.psych is looking for two elements of the x object: x$loadings and x$scores, you can create the appropriate object to plot, or add it to the factor object See the third and 	fourth examples.

In order to just plot the loadings, use \code{\link{fa.plot}}.  Or, if we want to show the loadings as vectors, use pch = "".
