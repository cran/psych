\title{Find Cohen's kappa and weighted kappa coefficients for correlation of two raters}
\description{Cohen's kappa (Cohen, 1960) and weighted kappa (Cohen, 1968) may be used to find the agreement of two raters when using nominal scores.  

weighted.kappa is (probability of observed matches - probability of expected matches)/(1 - probability of expected matches).  Kappa just considers the matches on the main diagonal.  Weighted kappa considers off diagonal elements as well.

\usage{
cohen.kappa(x, w=NULL,n.obs=NULL,alpha=.05,levels=NULL)  
wkappa(x, w = NULL)    #deprectated
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{Either a two by n data with categorical values from 1 to p or a p x p table.  If a data array, a table will be found.}
  \item{w}{A p x p matrix of weights.  If not specified, they are set to be 0 (on the diagonal) and (distance from diagonal) off the diagonal)^2. }
  \item{n.obs}{Number of observations (if input is a square matrix.}
  \item{alpha}{Probability level for confidence intervals}
  \item{levels}{Specify the number of levels if some levels of x or y are completely missing}
  
}
\details{When categorical judgments are made with two categories, a measure of relationship is the phi coefficient.  However, some categorical judgments are made using more than two outcomes.  For example, two diagnosticians might be asked to categorize patients three ways (e.g., Personality disorder, Neurosis, Psychosis) or to categorize the stages of a disease.  Just as base rates affect observed cell frequencies in a two by two table, they need to be considered in the n-way table (Cohen, 1960). 

Kappa considers the matches on the main diagonal.  A penalty function (weight) may be applied to the off diagonal matches.  If the weights increase by the square of the distance from the diagonal, weighted kappa is similar to an Intra Class Correlation (\code{\link{ICC}}).

Derivations of weighted kappa are sometimes expressed in terms of similarities, and sometimes in terms of dissimilarities. In the latter case, the weights on the diagonal are 1 and the weights off the diagonal are less than one. In this, if the weights are 1 - squared distance from the diagonal / k, then the result is similar to the ICC (for any positive k).  

cohen.kappa may use either similarity weighting (diagonal = 0) or dissimilarity weighting (diagonal = 1) in order to match various published examples. 

The input may be a two column data.frame or matrix with columns representing the two judges and rows the subjects being rated. Alternatively, the input may be a square n x n matrix of counts or proportion of matches.  If proportions are used, it is necessary to specify the number of observations (n.obs) in order to correctly find the confidence intervals.

The confidence intervals are based upon the variance estimates discussed by Fleiss, Cohen, and Everitt who corrected the formulae of Cohen (1968) and Blashfield.

Some data sets will include data with numeric categories with some category values missing completely.  In the sense that kappa is a measure of category relationship, this should not matter.  But when finding weighted kappa, the number of categories weighted will be less than the number of categories potentially in the data.  This can be remedied by specifying the levels parameter.

\note{As is true of many R functions, there are alternatives in other packages.  The Kappa function in the vcd package estimates unweighted and weighted kappa and reports the variance of the estimate. The input is a square matrix. The ckappa and wkappa functions in the psy package take raw data matrices.

To avoid confusion with Kappa (from vcd) or the kappa function from base, the function was originally named wkappa. With additional features modified from psy::ckappa to allow input with a different number of categories, the function has been renamed cohen.kappa.  

Unfortunately, to make it more confusing, the weights described by Cohen are a function of the reciprocals of those discucssed by Fleiss and Cohen. The cohen.kappa function uses the appropriate formula for Cohen or Fleiss-Cohen weights. 

There are some cases where the large sample size approximation of Fleiss et al. will produce confidence intervals exceeding +/- 1.  Clearly, for these cases, the upper (or lower for negative values) should be set to 1.  Boot strap resampling shows the problem is that the values are not symmetric.  See the last (unrun) example.
